### Python-Automation
#
* I have created a menu driven program which can automate **Basic Linux Commands,Partitions,LVM,Hadoop,Docker,AWS-CLI,Web-Server,Ansible** concepts.Anyone can use this program to configure Docker,Web Server and setup HDFS cluster & can work easily with all the basics concepts with all these tools & technologies without knowing the commands.

* We have done the following things :-

### Basic linux commands

* Run following Basic linux commands locally and remotely.

```
